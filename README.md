# guess-the-number-game
Hey! This is a tiny Python game I made because empty GitHub profiles look sad ðŸ˜….  
The computer thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it.  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Play

1. Clone the repo or download the `guess_the_number.py` file.
2. Run the game:
```bash
python guess_the_number.py
